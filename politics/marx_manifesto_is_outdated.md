I recently read the "Communist Manifesto" and I struggle to understand how so many people can still consider it relevant today. The manifesto declares a battle against the bourgeois class of the time. Back then, social mobility was extremely limited: you were born poor, had no access to education, and died poor; you were born rich, had access to a wealth of opportunities, and most likely died rich.

It's quite understandable that the working class felt unjustly exploited.

But today, the manifesto is absolutely no longer valid. It's not a much more accessible healthcare and education that really makes the difference: the real game-changer is the **Internet**. The Internet has completely dismantled all class, gender, and ethnic differences. Thanks to the internet, people with fewer traditional opportunities still have access to a boundless world of information.  Thanks to the internet, it's possible to study anything humanity has ever thought, spoken, or written down; it's possible to participate more actively in political life, and so on. All of this without any limited-access barriers.  Are you neither blind nor deaf?  Good, then you can learn anything the human species has ever conceived.

The Internet is the most powerful weapon created since writing and mathematics. Those who don't take advantage of it shouldn't then complain about living in an unjust society, because people may behave selfishly, but the tools to emancipate oneself from those selfish individuals are nonetheless available.
