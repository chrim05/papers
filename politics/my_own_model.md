As described in the document `./the_popular_models.md`, here are some of the major problems affecting the most common governance and market models (mostly in European countries):

*   **Divided Country**: Most elections result in a slight majority for one party, rarely a landslide victory; this suggests that half the country will be satisfied and half will not (excluding voter abstention).
*   **Manipulated Country**: Voters are often swayed by illusory/false propaganda or kept unaware of intentionally hidden wrongdoings through tools like Media Flooding (filling the media with superfluous news to distract from more concerning events).
*   **Inconsistent Country**: The country potentially reverses course on domestic economies and foreign/domestic policy with each term (every 4/5 years or sooner).
*   **Inconsistent Parties**: After winning elections, parties tend to backtrack on campaign promises, act much less than promised, and make choices never mentioned before that even their own voters would not support.
*   **Legislative Rigidity**: Difficulty in changing laws.
*   **Organizational Inefficiency**.
*   **Inefficiency of Public Spending**.
*   **Lack of Action**: Often due to bureaucratic friction, very few changes tend to be made during a term.
*   **Excessive Welfare State**: The welfare state is a strongly socialist ideal (redistribution of taxed wealth in the form of public services available to all regardless of meritocratic factors), which promotes Equality (but not Equity!) and requires high taxation for funding; these public services are also often subject to significant inefficiencies, forcing citizens to opt for private alternatives (thus partially losing utility).
*   **Very High Risk of Elitism**: Politicians in power become puppets of entrepreneurs who financed/pushed their propaganda using their special tools (e.g., the owner of a social network can easily suppress opposing political content while favoring those endorsing their agenda). This practice has a particularly capitalist undertone and should be strongly regulated with the same determination used to regulate Insider Trading.
*   **Potential Direct Election Manipulation**: As stated by former CIA Director James Woolsey Jr., America has interfered with and manipulated foreign elections more than once (and not just in the distant past); the voting process should be completely decentralized using blockchain-like technology.

**Desired Market Model:**

The basic idea is to reduce the Welfare State to its bare minimum, which would allow for significantly lower taxes on businesses and the removal of taxes for freelancers below a certain annual income threshold, potentially yielding several advantages:

*   **Very High Minimum Wages** (based on role, with a generic role classification): Thanks to significantly lower taxes, the government could impose very high minimum wages on companies (contract structure: minimum threshold based on role + an additional percentage of the minimum threshold, where the additional percentage could be 0% and would be agreed upon between employer and employee, but it's important it's linked to the minimum threshold for practical reasons explained below).
*   **Leave Money Directly in Workers' Pockets**: Instead of redistributing it through public services in an erroneously Equal and not Equitable way, individual citizens would be free to spend that money differently and/or more efficiently.
*   **Protect Salaries from Inflation**: The government would increase minimum wages month by month at the same rate as currency devaluation (the additional percentage would also increase because it's linked to the fixed minimum threshold); one might think the employer would unfairly bear the additional offset, but inflation would also be raising the prices of the company's products/services, so revenues would also increase, ultimately resulting in a rebalancing of money quantities (although this is a simplistic hypothesis and would need concrete proof); inflation is extremely useful for preventing the stagnation of large liquid assets (thus stimulating the domestic economy), but it has unpleasant side effects (including raising prices of products and services **but not salaries**).
*   **Massive Reduction of Unreported Employment** (working legally would only have advantages at this point).
*   **End Mandatory Public Pensions**: It would make more sense to leave the money in people's hands and instead direct them to invest in safe assets to combat the inflation of the amount saved. This way, everyone could set aside their desired amount, investing it how and where they wish, or use it in extreme emergencies at their own discretion.

**Desired Governance Model:**

I get the impression that politics today is merely a large stage where the best orator wins the country, while the most competent struggle to emerge.

Furthermore, the problem of **False Representativeness** of elected parties often arises: many parties, after winning elections, start making decisions that contradict their campaign promises or new decisions that were never mentioned at all.

One idea to solve both problems is as follows: every party must publish a **Legal Sovereignty Document**, which serves as a list of actions the party can undertake freely after winning the election, with full executive power. So, a kind of party program with legal value.
The Sovereign has executive power over everything mentioned in the Sovereignty Document.
Any other decision not mentioned in the document must be made through a **public Referendum**.

I have renamed the figure of the Premier to "Sovereign" purely for conceptual clarity (Premier is a term with ideologies too tied to the current method of democracy, which I personally dislike, and I need a new term that appears more authoritarian, yet in a completely legitimate way and restricted within extremely democratic limits).

The Sovereignty Document could potentially be subject to some limits (such as the requirement of Constitutionality of its content or adherence to a simple and minimal communication format), although the idea of imposing a constitutionality requirement doesn't personally inspire me much, considering it would still be the people themselves deciding in the first place. Why not allow a document containing unconstitutional items if the people have democratically accepted them anyway?

The Sovereign in power could, with the help of the people (Referendum), prosecute high-importance public roles (judges, public prosecutors, etc.) to end internal corruption or phenomena like Insider Trading and related issues that are often inevitable when high-importance public roles are not appropriately controlled.

Furthermore, it is fundamentally important to **digitally decentralize** voting: Referendums and party votes should be digitally decentralized (Blockchain) to prevent any kind of interference or cover-up (events that are not entirely impossible, as mentioned earlier).

A substantial reduction in bureaucracy would be another important step for today's governments.
