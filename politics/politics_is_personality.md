The **Left-Right Wing** (LRW) spectrum is highly debated, and its associated values vary across time and space (the values of the two factions have changed throughout history and also differ depending on the country).

However, it is still not entirely clear what the ideals of each side are, and for this reason, people often fall into flawed interpretations and resort to a false dichotomy of "We are the good ones, you are the bad ones!" although it is entirely a matter of personality.

My personal formal definition of this spectrum aims to connect political alignment, more or less directly, with individual personality: in the document at the path `./the_popular_models.md`, I presented a modular and minimal view of current politics where a core feature of the Overall Model was in fact the **Social Interaction Model**, a model describing individuals' approach to social interaction: Competition vs Cooperation.

The two approaches can be combined, but the underlying concept remains the same. My personal interpretation seeks to base the LRW political spectrum on the social interaction spectrum: on the left side (Left), we place Cooperation, and on the right side (Right), Competition.

Automatically, this yields the following result (for symmetry and consistency): on the far left appears the highest degree of Cooperation imaginable (a Stateless society based on cooperation: **Pure Communism**), and on the far right, the highest degree of Competition imaginable (a Stateless society based on competition: **Pure Capitalism**, also known as Anarcho-Capitalism).

In the center, we find the middle grounds that seek to combine the best aspects of each (Cooperation -> greater Humanitarian Values, Competition -> greater Meritocratic Values, broadly speaking).

These middle grounds tend to require a Mediator (Government), but its role gradually diminishes as we move towards the extremes.

Through this interpretation, we can perhaps better understand some typical and stereotypical behaviors. For example: on the left, there tends to be a mentality of "imposition" precisely because cooperation only works if the majority adheres to it; on the right, conversely, there is a tendency to downplay the most basic humanitarian values, viewing them as rhetoric that simplifies self-advancement in the "Great Race".

Both sides aim for **Individual Freedom** but through different means. Neither faction represents objective correctness: moral values and ideals of justice are entirely subjective and influenced by one's personality.
