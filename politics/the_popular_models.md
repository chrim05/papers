In this document, I want to illustrate my interpretation of the most popular theoretical models of governance (in order of decentralization):
* Anarchy
* Oligarchy

In combination with the most popular models of market and public money management:
* Capitalism
* Socialism

Further combined with the following models of social interaction:
* Competition
* Cooperation

And further combined with the following selection models:
* Democracy
* Natural

----

I like to think of the aforementioned models in the following way:
* Governance:
    * Class: Social protocols
    * Inter-combinability: No, anarchy does not allow centralized power and conversely, oligarchy does not allow decentralized power.

* Market:
    * Class: Management rules
    * Inter-combinability: Yes, for example: regulated capitalism + public healthcare.

* Interaction:
    * Class: Individual's philosophy on the social approach
    * Inter-combinability: Potentially yes, for example: I compete with some individuals, but with others, I choose to cooperate.

* Selection:
    * Class: Choice protocols
    * Explanation: A Natural selection protocol is a model in which choices are made by entities foreseen by the governance model, therefore "natural" in two senses:
        * First: It follows the reference structure, for example: in a dictatorship (oligarchic governance), it is rare for choices to be made democratically, and much more likely that they are made by the dictator, as **precisely** foreseen by the dictatorial structure.
        * Second: The law of the strongest, with obviously symbolic meaning, where strength can be strategic intelligence, actions of convenience, ..., for example: a political choice is indirectly forced by military actions perpetrated by rival governments.

    * Inter-combinability: Potentially yes, for example: some choices can be made through majority voting, others delegated to central entities, for example, a Prime Minister.

---

A final model is a complex composed of the aforementioned elementary models, chosen from the respective 4 classes (Governance, Market, Interaction, Selection).

Examples:
* Italy:
    * Governance: Oligarchy
    * Market: Heavily regulated capitalism + redistribution of public money in the form of services (healthcare, education, infrastructure, bonuses for low-income families, ...)
    * Interaction: Generally competition, potential alliances between parties
    * Selection: Democracy regarding the direct voting of parties or referendums, Natural in the rest of the choices, delegated to the Prime Minister and the elected party.

* USA:
    * Governance: Oligarchy
    * Market: Capitalism
    * Interaction: Competition
    * Selection: Low Democracy + Strong Natural, for example: the president has executive power and can sign executive orders at will, as long as they are not unconstitutional or whose control does not belong to the presidential figure.

* Communism (pure):
    * Governance: Anarchy
    * Market: Socialism
    * Interaction: Cooperation
    * Selection: Democracy/Natural

* Absolute Monarchy:
    * Governance: Oligarchy
    * Market: Low on both sides
    * Interaction: Cooperation/Competition
    * Selection: Natural

One could argue, however, that it is not entirely correct to associate democratic selection with oligarchic governance, but the truth is that the definitions available online, and a bit of simplification of the concepts, actually allow the association. The three powers, although distributed, remain centralized in public entities in which we must place trust, managed by people in whom we must place further trust.

The level of centralization is actually very high, so the narrative of "power to the people" is rather illusory: the people in charge can make a series of choices that satisfy their personal interests, masking the matter with sufficiently solid excuses; however, it remains a valid narrative, albeit very imprecise, since any citizen can actively participate in political life under usually quite trivial requirements.

Precisely for this reason, we can say that the USA is a republic in all respects: political participation accessible to any citizen; but we cannot say that it is a democracy, in fact, placing it on a 0-100 spectrum (0 = Only Elite, 100 = Referendum for everything), I would personally estimate a range of 40-60, a middle ground between a pure oligarchy (accessible to a lucky few) and an aristocracy (accessible to a few best).

It is therefore clear that the aforementioned models are purely theoretical and in the application of the latter, one often finds oneself in variants, or rather: in a spectrum. Just as by looking at a soccer ball we can recognize its spherical shape, despite it losing some characteristics of the theoretical sphere.
We can also add that even the inter-combinations of models are in a spectrum between one model and another and that it is unlikely that both can coexist at the "maximum" or "minimum".

----

My interpretation has as its key point the **modular** vision of these concepts, making them not only intra and inter combinable, but also reusable in *sub-contexts*, for example: in an Anarchy it often happens that the individual interacts with society in a highly competitive way, consequently approaching life with individualistic ideologies; individualism that, however, does not necessarily indicate a single person, but potentially also a small group of people, for example, a family. Now here is demonstrated the importance of the modular vision that I mentioned: that family would probably interact in a very competitive way with society, however internally (*sub-context*) models completely opposite to the individualistic ideology could be established, for example:
* Communism (Cooperation): family members help each other, regardless of any social debts that a member may not yet have settled with other family members, for example: multiple favors not yet returned.
* Democracy (pure): members make decisions through majority voting; other models can automatically emerge, such as competition in cases of internal propaganda to convince other members to vote for one option rather than another.
* Socialism: members distribute the results equally, depending on the contribution.
* Oligarchy (pure): few members make the decisions, Natural selection model, for example: the oldest decides.

----

The **Scalability** of the models is another important characteristic to consider, a characteristic that is introduced precisely thanks to the modular vision.
If in fact before we would have generalized by saying, for example, "Communism (pure) does not work, because it is not possible to convince everyone to cooperate without impositions, and imposing it would no longer be communism", now we can more correctly state that communism is, instead, a model with very low scalability and its applicability depends strictly on the context and the size of the group, for example: in families it is not rare at all to find a communist model and this works without any problem, thanks to the emotional baggage shared between the members of the group and the small size of the latter.

Other models are less sensitive to scalability, but even these, at certain levels, begin to suffer from equally serious problems, including some examples:
* Democracy:
    * Divisive Voting: society is divided into 2 large factions, there is a tendency to lose sight of the real objectives, to run only to compete with rival parties, and to vote on the basis of the behavior of the characters and not their ideas.
    * Manipulable Voting: fake news, illusory propaganda, ..., Although they may seem secondary elements, they actually constitute a real plague of today's governments.
    * Ignorant Voting: the vote is potentially devoid of due research and documentation, often one can find oneself voting without knowing precisely the candidate's program.
    * To the detriment of others: the choice of the candidate is potentially conditioned by personal interests.
    * Potential reversal of course at each term, the country may struggle to remain stable on ideals, overturn important international relations, etc ...
    *Indirection: that of modern democracy is mainly a narrative, aimed at convincing citizens to have real control over the future of the country and Referendums are unusual.
    * Legislative Rigidity: legislation is generally not very flexible, making it unavailable for substantial changes, which is a useful protection against malicious intent, but very limiting for new ideas, effectively adding a lot of friction in the evolution of society, which will have to face new problems with old tools.
    * Less Valuable Public Opinion: often some dynamics, especially international ones, require a certain degree of confidentiality, effectively making the opinion of the people on certain issues less important, since it is based on incomplete information.

* Socialism:
    * Organizational Inefficiency: public services tend to lose quality and convenience, opting for private solutions, as in the case of public healthcare, which could require up to months to obtain an important examination, such as a CT scan or an X-ray.
    * Inefficiency of Public Spending: the staff in charge of managing public spending may not be careful with expenses on some fronts, as indeed often happens in Italy.
    * Equal but not Fair: the welfare state needs high taxation, which discourages citizens from doing business or declaring income, at the same time, even those who do not work are still entitled to the same services as those who have put their savings and comforts at risk.

* Oligarchy:
    * Low transparency: high risk of corruption.
    * Oppressive Tendency: little individual freedom, you may find yourself forced to emigrate to escape rules that you do not share.

* Capitalism (pure):
    * Possible human rights violations, without certain consequences.

* Capitalism (moderate):
    * Elitism: a group of people (elite) maneuvers the masses by means of their wealth, lobbies and ensorsment are pure corruption even if it's packaged differently.

* Communism (pure):
    * Practical impossibility in ensuring that everyone really contributes their best and really takes only what they need, an adequate mentality is necessary.

The search for a model that solves these problems is not at all simple, it is recommended to read the document that deals with this very topic at the path: `./my_own_model.md`
